CS256 Project Proposal – PLL LACROSSE LEAGUE DATABASE
Geno Casceillo


Domain
My project will be to create a database the PLL can use to cross reference data between the 8 teams and the starting players and identify outliers and who is good at what position or what special skills.

This can offer an in depth look at if someone is in the wrong spot or able to trade to another team to gain a better offense or defense. Such as if a team is lacking in one area, they can create a trade with another team, to hopefully create better opportunities for both teams.
Motivation
The most important part is being able to look at the data and display what position they are, what they do on the field performance wise, and does another team need that position to succeed. For example, Team A is lacking in offense. They need a finisher because most of their goals are from players that are shooters and not inside goals. The best thing we can do is categorize a player based on his position and playstyle and cross reference them with other teams. By doing this you can see that Team B needs a new goalie, because they have been scored on too much from the outside. Team A can recognize this and trade a goalie with better statistics to Team B for an inside finisher attackman. This database you will be able to see all types of stats and compare them to other teams based on position and rank this year.
